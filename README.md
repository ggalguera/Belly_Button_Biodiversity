# Belly Button Biodiversity Dynamic Charts

## Purpose
Improbable Beef has created an interactive website called Belly Button Biodiversity to aid in their search for a particular type of bacteria found in the human belly button, which they hope to use in the production of synthetic beef. The website gathers and analyzes data on the ten most common types of bacteria found, as well as information on how frequently each person washes their belly button and the complete list of bacteria found in a single sample.
